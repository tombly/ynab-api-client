    /// If specified, a new transaction will be assigned this `import_id` and considered "imported".  We will also attempt to match this imported transaction to an existing "user-entered" transaction on the same account, with the same amount, and with a date +/-10 days from the imported transaction date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Transactions imported through File Based Import or Direct Import (not through the API) are assigned an import_id in the format: 'YNAB:[milliunit_amount]:[iso_date]:[occurrence]'. For example, a transaction dated 2015-12-30 in the amount of -$294.23 USD would have an import_id of 'YNAB:-294230:2015-12-30:1'.  If a second transaction on the same account was imported and had the same date and same amount, its import_id would be 'YNAB:-294230:2015-12-30:2'.  Using a consistent format will prevent duplicates through Direct Import and File Based Import.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If import_id is omitted or specified as null, the transaction will be treated as a "user-entered" transaction. As such, it will be eligible to be matched against transactions later being imported (via DI, FBI, or API).
